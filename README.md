Martini Algorithm: 
Wrote code to support the printing of a martini glass to the console using ASCII characters. It supports the taking of an integer value that represents the size of the martini glass to outputted. Code was written in C#. 

Wrote a program in C++ that used both quicksort and randomized quicksort methods to sort N randomly generated integers and to then analyze both methodsâ€™ run times to see which was more efficient.
